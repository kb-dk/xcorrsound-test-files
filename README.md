#xcorrsound-test-files

Test Files for correctness testing and SCAPE benchmarking of xcorrSound waveform-compare tool.

The SCAPE xcorrSound tool set can be found here https://github.com/openplanets/scape-xcorrsound

The xcorrSound waveform-compare tool assumes correct wave files as input. When we use the tool in
SCAPE audio migration quality assurance, the correct wave files are assured by a JHove2 file format
validation. The SCAPE audio migration quality assurance workflow also includes an FFprobe property
extraction and comparison. The comparison workflow can be found on myExperiment
http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3521.html
The workflow requires the involved tools to be installed locally.

This workflow is also part of the Github repository https://github.com/statsbiblioteket/scape-audio-qa
which further includes scripts to set up the paths to the installed tools, and to run the workflow.

This project includes a script to run waveform-compare with the default settings on all the test files.

Note the classification of files into similar and not similar is debatable. The difference in challenge-pmd.wav
and original.wav is not audible to the human ear, and is only discovered by the waveform-compare tool if the
match threshold is set to at least 0.9999994 (the default is 0.98). This means that our tool does not always
'catch' hidden images. We think these files are similar! The difference between challenge-TE-1.wav
and original.wav is also not audible, and only discoverable with threshold>=0.99993, and we think they are similar.
The difference between challenge-TE-2.wav and original.wav is audible, but only discoverable with threshold>=0.99.
The question is whether to accept these as similar. They certainly are similar, but this test file represents a
loss of quality, and if we accept this loss of quality in a migration once, what happens if this file is migrated
50 times? So perhaps the default threshold should be 0.99?

*And then there is challenge-KFC-3.wav. The difference here is certainly audible, and the test file sounds
awful. The waveform-compare tool however only compares one channel (default channel 0) and outputs success
with offset 0. If waveform-compare is set to compare channel 1, it again outputs success, but this time with
offset 3959. This suggest that the tool should be run on both (all) channels, and the offsets compared.

Note that the DER files are all mono, and thus this issue does not arise.

Note that the sound waves are compared in blocks. The block size also influences the result. If the block size is large,
a short audible mismatch may be missed. We have set the default block size down from 5 to one second.

##Sound file attribution and provenance

All sound files with file names starting with 'challenge' are derived from a snippet of a Danish Radio P3 broadcast
from October 31st 1995 approximately 8:13 till 8:15 am. The rest of the files are derived from a snippet of
"Danmarks Erhvervsradio" (Danish Business Radio) from a show called "BÃ¸rs & Valuta med Amagerbanken" from 8th of
January 2002 from 8:45 till 9 am.
